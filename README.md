# Space Station 0
This is the main server application for Space Station 0. Space Station 0 is a multiplayer round-based roleplaying game where you
must do your job and survive on a treacherous space station embedded in the depths of a massive asteroid.

It is based on the game Space Station 13, and can be considered a 'remake' of that game in a general sense,
although many in-game mechanics have changed greatly.

## Gameplay features of Space Station 0
- Play 10 different jobs: Captain, Chef, Engineer, Security Officer, Miner, Scientist, Quartermaster, Janitor,
Doctor, and of course, Clown.
- Complex and emergent game mechanics, including but definitely not limited to:
  - 2D physics engine that accurately simulates bullet paths, collisions, and explosions
  - Atmospheric engine that realistically simulates how gasses circulate and move
  - Chemistry system with 40+ chemicals
  - Accurate medical system that simulates organs, bones, blood flow, and nerves.
  - Advanced circuitry: any electronic component of any item can be deconstructed and re-wired
  - Easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master combat system with many different ways to fight
  - Hundreds of items
  - Fully destructable environment
  - Spaceships and shuttles with independent tile-maps.
- Smooth lighting
- Randomly generated structures and dozens of enemies to fight within the asteroid
- 4 unique gamemodes
- Smart administration and moderation tools

Space Station 0 is also designed to be easy to run, and easy to contribute to. There is extensive documentation
for every part of the codebase, allowing any coder to get up-to-speed and start helping out in 30 minutes
or less. The contribution guide can be founding under `CONTRIBUTING.md` and steps to install and run can be found
under `INSTALLATION.md`.

This software is licensed under the AGPLv3.0 license. In short, this means that you can fork the code and use
it to your hearts content: but if you run a public server, you must provide a public link to the source code
for the server.
