# Space Station 0
This is the main application for Space Station 0. Space Station 0 is a singleplayer survival game on a procedurally-generated space station
with permadeath mechanics. It also can be run as a multiplayer game.

It is heavily inspired by the multiplayer game Space Station 13, and shares many of its mechanics.

## Gameplay features of Space Station 0

Space Station 0 is also designed to be easy to run, and easy to contribute to. There is extensive documentation
for every part of the codebase, allowing any coder to get up-to-speed and start helping out in 30 minutes
or less. The contribution guide can be founding under `CONTRIBUTING.md` and steps to install and run can be found
under `INSTALLATION.md`.

This software is licensed under the AGPLv3.0 license. In short, this means that you can fork the code and use
it to your hearts content: but if you run a public server, you must provide a public link to the source code
for the server.
